            <p id="first-p">Hi! Iâ€™m Avi. I live in San Francisco, CA. I go to Urban which is just down the hill from my
                house. I love learning. Here is some of the stuff I like to do and more about me!</p>

                    <h2>Astronomy</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I saw Jupiter and Saturn through a CITs telescope at sleep away camp a few years ago
                        I've been interested in astronomy.
                        Inspired by him I got a 70mm refractor telescope that fits in a backpack. Using that and my
                        iPhone 10 I was able to capture this image of the moon.
                        I've also learned many of the constellations and occasionaly use a high-power laser to show them
                        to others.</p>

                    <h2>Physics Things</h2>
                    <p>I'm learning about Fluid Simulation. I'm currently considering doing a Eularian grid-based to
                        start and then
                        upgrading to a FLIP simulator. I'm using python and pygame along with a few other useful
                        libraries like numpy. This did not work out but it inspired me to look into Unity and I ended up
                        making a simple orbital simulator in it.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://screeps.com/">Screeps</a> is a game I learned about from a <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/A8SythA_P_U?si=XzrAq7j-C-_ayEwo">YouTube video</a>. In it I use
                        Javascript to control a
                        colony of creeps. I'm playing to learn more about Javascript which I'm considering adding to
                        this site.</p>
