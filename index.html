                        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
                        <p>Ever since I saw Jupiter and Saturn through a CITs telescope at sleep away camp a few years ago I've been interested in astronomy. 
                            Inspired by him I got a 70mm refractor telescope that fits in a backpack. Using that and my iPhone 10 I was able to capture this image of the moon.
                            I've also learned many of the constellations and occasionaly use a high-power laser to show them to others.</p>

                        <p>I'm learning about it. I'm currently considering doing a Eularian grid-based to start and then upgrading to a FLIP simulator. I'm using python and pygame along with a few other useful libraries like numpy</p>
