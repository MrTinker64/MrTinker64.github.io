            <p>I’m in 10th grade at the <a href="https://www.urbanschool.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Urban School of San Francisco
            </a>. I’m lead programmer on <a href="https://www.sfunityrobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                SFUnity, FRC Team 9038
            </a>. I made a bot on Discord that facilitates a game of Hearts with four people. I play the tenor saxophone in Urban’s
            lab band and Blues combo. On my own time I play the piano. I’m a member of Urbans fencing team. I’m a member of the
            Digital Innovators Group at Urban where we are currently forming a suite of digital accessibility tools for teachers to
            use in the classroom. I go to the Kitchen and am part of their teen social justice program Freedom City. We are
            currently making a website to support a collaboration between the Kitchen and GLIDE called One City to support newly
            housed people. In the future I’d like to learn about and create fluid simulations and AI. I also like to read, mostly
            sci-fi and scientific nonfiction. I have a telescope and I have used it for some astrophotography:</p>
